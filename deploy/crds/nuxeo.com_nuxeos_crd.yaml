                items:
                  description: "A backing service specifies three things: 1) a list
                    of cluster resources from which to obtain connection configuration
                    values like passwords and certificates, and the corresponding
                    projections of those values into the Nuxeo Pod. 2) A nuxeo.conf
                    string that can reference the projected resource values. 3) A
                    name. The name is important because it is used by the operator
                    as a base directory into which to mount files. Files are mounted
                    under /etc/nuxeo-operator/binding/<the name you assign>. \n Once
                    the operator is finished configuring all of the backing service
                    bindings, all of the nuxeo.conf entries are concatenated and appended
                    to the operator-managed nuxeo.conf ConfigMap. The Nuxeo CR offers
                    the ability to specify inline nuxeo.conf values in the Nuxeo CR.
                    If these are specified, the backing service settings are appended.
                    The Nuxeo CR also offers the ability to define nuxeo.conf content
                    in an externally provisioned ConfigMap or Secret and to reference
                    that in the Nuxeo CR. An externally provisioned nuxeo.conf ConfigMap
                    or Secret is not compatible with backing services and will result
                    in a reconciliation error. Only inlined nuxeo.conf content is
                    supported with backing services - because the Operator has to
                    have ownership of the cluster resource holding the nuxeo.conf
                    content and it can't do that if the resource is provisioned by
                    the configurer. (Because as of Nuxeo 10.10 only one nuxeo.conf
                    can exist in /docker-entrypoint-initnuxeo.d to be processed by
                    the Nuxeo startup script.)"

                              packages in a Kubernetes cluster without connectivity
                              to the Nuxeo Marketplace. A configurer creates or downloads
                              a marketplace package ZIP, and configures a storage
                              resource containing the ZIP for that package. A Nuxeo
                              CR is configured that references that resource. The
                              Operator configures Nuxeo so that - on startup - Nuxeo
                              installs the package into the running Nuxeo instance.
                              In the current version, only ConfigMaps and Secrets
                              can be used to hold the package binaries. And only one
                              package ZIP per ConfigMap/Secret is supported. The reason
                              for this is the the Nuxeo container init shell script
                              only supports installing packages from a single directory
                              level. In order to support a persistent volume and claim,
                              the Nuxeo script needs to be modified to support sub-directories.
                              If that change is made by Nuxeo, then this Operator
                              will be updated to support mounting a volume into a
                              subdirectory of the Nuxeo container init directory.
                              This will make it possible to do offline installation
                              from a single volume containing multiple packages.
