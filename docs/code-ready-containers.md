## Using Code Ready Containers

The OpenShift testing for the current operator version uses Code Ready Containers (CRC): https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers/overview. The testing was performed on Ubuntu 18.04.

The default CRC install assumes a different Linux lineage then Ubuntu and so getting CRC to run successfully on Ubuntu requires manual intervention in the networking configuration as part of the CRC installation process. Presently, for me, I work around this by configuring my etc/hosts with certain entries - shown below - to support testing.

Specifically, note the `nuxeo-server.apps-crc.testing` host name - which maps to the Route generated by the Operator in this testing scenario. (This will be made clear further on down in the README.)

```shell
192.168.130.1   crc.testing
192.168.130.11  api.crc.testing
192.168.130.11  apps-crc.testing
192.168.130.11  foo.apps-crc.testing
192.168.130.11  oauth-openshift.apps-crc.testing
192.168.130.11  default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps-crc.testing
192.168.130.11  nuxeo-server.apps-crc.testing
192.168.130.11  console-openshift-console.apps-crc.testing
```

The IP addresses shown above are hard-coded in the CRC binary for the CRC version shown below, and with the corresponding CRC configuration settings:

```shell
$ ./crc version
crc version: 1.9.0+a68b5e0
OpenShift version: 4.3.10 (embedded in binary)
$ ./crc config view
- skip-check-crc-dnsmasq-file           : true
- skip-check-network-manager-config     : true
- skip-check-network-manager-installed  : true
- skip-check-network-manager-running    : true
```

In addition, configure the Docker registry for insecure access to the OpenShift integrated image registry: 

```shell
$ sudo cat /etc/docker/daemon.json
{
    "insecure-registries" : ["default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps-crc.testing"]
}
```

And finally, ensure you're logged in to the cluster as `kubeadmin`:

```shell
$ oc status
In project default on server https://api.crc.testing:6443
...
$ oc whoami
kube:admin
```
