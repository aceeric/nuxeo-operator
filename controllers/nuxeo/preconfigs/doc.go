/*
This package contains the code that interprets the "preConfigs" resource in the Nuxeo CR. These CR
stanzas are short-hands for known configurations so the configurer can quickly and easily integrate
a Nuxeo cluster to one or more backing services. All these functions do is return fully built-out
structures that implement a backing service binding.
